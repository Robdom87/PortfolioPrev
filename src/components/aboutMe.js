        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>I am a sophomore at the University of California, Los Angeles pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree
            in
            Business Economics with a minor in Accounting. I always adored the beautiful logic of numbers and my
            first
            accounting class here in UCLA really pushed my idealized interest in accounting into full fruition. I
            can
            recall very vividly the immense sense of satisfaction as my first 5-hour long problem set came to an end
            with a simple balancing of the credits and debits. Since then extensive involvement with Student
            Accounting
            Society and VITA, introduced me to professionals and aspiring accountants who helped me better
            understand
            the amazing opportunities available to me in the field.
