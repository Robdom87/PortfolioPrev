Welcome to my portfolio! It exists to exposee my work and provide more info on myself. The Site is divided into four sections: Header, Bio, Projects, and Contact.

The Bio section is a quick overview on my background and goals within the space.

The Projects provides clickable links to all of my deployed projects.
